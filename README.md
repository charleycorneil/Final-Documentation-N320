# Final Project

## Project Summary

Our project is an interactive website that discusses myths and folklore, focusing on cryptids. Through a region-based system or point-and-click map, visitors can explore a variety of species on this instructional website. Pop-up facts or infographics regarding particular cryptids, such Bigfoot or the Jersey Devil,  will be displayed.

Pages would have a brief quiz that tests the user's understanding of the content in order to improve user engagement. The project's goal is to combine interactive elements, education, and storytelling in an aesthetic that is appealing. Our group decided on this subject because of an interest with folklore and wanted to produce an entertaining and educational display.
