# Final Project

## Project Summary

Our project is an interactive website that discusses myths and folklore, focusing on cryptids. Through a region-based system or point-and-click map, visitors can explore a variety of species on this instructional website. Pop-up facts or infographics regarding particular cryptids, such as Bigfoot or the Jersey Devil,  will be displayed.

Pages would have a brief quiz that tests the user's understanding of the content in order to improve user engagement. The project's goal is to combine interactive elements, education, and storytelling in an aesthetic that is appealing. Our group decided on this subject because of an interest with folklore and wanted to produce an entertaining and educational display.

## Key Takeaways

From this project, we hope to provide a smooth, unique, and engaging experience for users that are interested in folklore and mythology. In doing so, we hope to fine tune our skills in creating dynamic interactive webpages and ability to work within a team. -terry

## Core Webpages

MAP- The map will display different areas that can be clicked on. Clicking on these areas would take the user to a cryptid that resides there.

CRYPTIDS- Cryptid pages can be accessed when clicking on a certain area on the map. These pages will display the cryptid that lives there, along with information about them. Clicking on certain things on the page will load pop-ups, displaying extra information or a quiz based on the cryptid

## Design Choices

gallery site that features popular mythological creatures from various folklore including creatures such as bigfoot, jersey devil, windigo, etc the site will imclude a quiz at the end of each page that quizes the users on their knowledge. the color pallet will resemble a dark and mystical vibe with muted green blue and black tones. -Eyanla
